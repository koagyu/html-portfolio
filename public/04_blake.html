        William Blake (28 November 1757 - 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. 
        Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of
        the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by
        20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportions to its merits the least read body
        of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones
        to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake
        was placed at number 3 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London 
        his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically
        rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence 
        itself".[7]

2        Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high 
        regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical
        undercurrents within his work. His painitings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic
        movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been said to be "a key early proponent of both
        Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed,
        to almost all organised religion), Blacke was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and
        American revolutions.
